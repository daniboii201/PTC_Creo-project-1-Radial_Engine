# ﻿PTC Creo project #1: Radial Engine
This project is my first complete assembly created in PTC Creo Parametric. It represents a simplified radial engine mechanism, commonly used in early aircraft engines. The design demonstrates the principles of radial motion, connecting rods, and pistons arranged around a central crankshaft.

The assembly includes:

• Five pistons arranged radially.

• A master connecting rod and articulated rods for each piston.

• A central hub and positioning pin for alignment.

• Supporting components such as link pins and engine cover.

## Project Objectives
• Learn and apply Creo part modeling and assembly techniques.

• Practice constraints, mechanism connections, and motion simulation.

• Understand the kinematics of a radial engine.

## Features
• Parametric parts for pistons, rods, and pins.

• Assembly structure with subassemblies for pistons and rods.

• Motion analysis capability (optional) to visualize piston movement.
